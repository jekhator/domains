# Code Review: domain-rag v0.1.1

**Date:** 2026-07-13  
**Package:** domain-rag  
**Version:** 0.1.1

## Design Review

### RetrievalProvenance (✓ Approved)

- Frozen dataclass with slots: immutable, hashable, efficient
- Factory methods (for_success/for_failure) follow domain-driven naming
- Validation in __post_init__ catches invalid states early
- Required fields (principal_id, session_id, query): enforce audit trail compliance
- Outcome enum (ProvenanceOutcome): StrEnum, SUCCESS/FAILURE, matches domain-monitoring pattern

### ProvenanceSink Protocol (✓ Approved)

- Structural typing via Protocol: no coupling to implementations
- Single record() method: minimal, focused surface (vs. emit() in domain-monitoring)
- CollectingProvenanceSink and NullProvenanceSink implementations cover test + default cases
- Vendor-neutral: no hard deps on LangSmith/Langfuse/OpenTelemetry; adapters are user-provided

### @traced_retrieval Decorator (✓ Approved)

- TARGET-POLYMORPHIC: callables and classes from day one
- Sync + async support: comprehensive coverage (mirrors domain-monitoring)
- Class fan-out: public method selection correct (skips private/inherited)
- Query extraction: heuristic (kwargs.get("query", args[0])) works for typical RAG patterns
- Chunk/source extraction: dict.get() fallback to empty tuples on mismatch
- Exception handling: records failure, re-raises, never swallows
- Sink resolution: provided → registry → NullProvenanceSink (sensible default)

### ProvenanceRegistry (✓ Approved)

- Global state exposed explicitly via set/get/clear methods
- No module-level mutable state escaping the class
- Settable at any time; test isolation via autouse fixture

### Error Hierarchy (✓ Approved)

- RetrievalError: generic, inherits from DomainError
- RetrievalDeclarationError: specific to invalid decorator targets
- Constants extracted: ERR_RETRIEVAL_* for all user-facing messages
- Mirrors domain-monitoring error pattern exactly

## Implementation Review

### Code Quality (✓ Approved)

- Type-clean: mypy strict, passes on domain_rag/
- Ruff-formatted: consistent style, no linting errors
- DTO discipline: frozen+slots, no facades, clear separation of concerns
- Constants extraction: all semantic strings extracted to constants/retrieval.py
- Follows suite standards (collections.abc, absolute imports, descriptive TypeVars)

### Test Coverage (✓ Approved)

- 100% coverage: All 31 tests passing
- Objects 100%: VO validation, factories, hashability, outcome enum
- Client 100%: sinks, protocol compliance, registry binding
- Decorator 100%: sync/async callables, class fan-out, error paths, registry resolution
- Per-feature structure: mirrors source organization (test_provenance, test_traced_retrieval, test_registry)

### Documentation (✓ Approved)

- README: run-verified class-level example, clear architecture overview
- Architecture: flow-trace.md with complete state diagram (boxed format)
- Docstrings: one-line on all modules/classes/methods
- Audits/reviews: security audit + code review files
- CHANGELOG: Unreleased section with feature summary

### CI/CD Gates (✓ Approved)

- Six workflows: CI (pytest 3.11/3.12 with 100% coverage floor), ruff, mypy, dto-strict, no-ai-attribution, cleanup-guard
- domain_rag included in:
  - strict-module.yml: lint loop + loc-cap loop
  - ci.yml: coverage report (100% floor enforcement)
  - mypy: type checking on domain_rag/
  - pyproject.toml: testpaths, coverage.source, ruff first-party, strict-module paths
- Branch protection: required_status_checks.strict=true, all contexts

## Conclusion

domain-rag 0.1.1 is **APPROVED** for release. Code is production-ready:
- Comprehensive design (provenance VO, sinks, decorator, registry)
- Full test coverage (100%)
- Clean type checking and linting (mypy/ruff pass)
- Security audit clear
- Documentation complete and verified
- Mirrors domain-monitoring architecture exactly

No changes required for v0.1.1. Ready to merge and publish.
