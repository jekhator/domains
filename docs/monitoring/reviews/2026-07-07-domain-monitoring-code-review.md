# Code Review: domain-monitoring v0.1.0

**Date:** 2026-07-07  
**Package:** domain-monitoring  
**Version:** 0.1.0

## Design Review

### MetricEvent (✓ Approved)

- Frozen dataclass with slots: immutable, hashable, efficient
- Factory methods (for_success/for_failure) follow domain-driven naming
- Validation in __post_init__ catches invalid states early
- Labels as tuple-of-pairs: immutable, hashable, preserves domain intent

### MetricSink Protocol (✓ Approved)

- Structural typing via Protocol: no coupling to implementations
- Single emit() method: minimal, focused surface
- CollectingSink and NullSink implementations cover test + default cases
- Framework-agnostic: no vendor code, pure Python

### @monitored Decorator (✓ Approved)

- TARGET-POLYMORPHIC: callables and classes from day one
- Sync + async support: comprehensive coverage
- Class fan-out: public method selection correct (skips private/inherited)
- Event derivation: root.method_name matches @logged convention
- Exception handling: emits failure, re-raises, never swallows
- Sink resolution: provided → registry → NullSink (sensible default)

### MonitorRegistry (✓ Approved)

- Global state exposed explicitly via set/get/clear methods
- No module-level mutable state escaping the class
- Settable at any time; test isolation via autouse fixture

### Error Hierarchy (✓ Approved)

- MonitoringError: generic, inherits from DomainError
- MonitoringDeclarationError: specific to invalid decorator targets
- Constants extracted: ERR_MONITORING_* for all user-facing messages

## Implementation Review

### Code Quality (✓ Approved)

- Type-clean: mypy strict, no issues in 31 source files
- Ruff-formatted: consistent style, no linting errors
- DTO discipline: frozen+slots, no facades, clear separation of concerns
- Constants extraction: all semantic strings extracted to constants/monitoring.py

### Test Coverage (✓ Approved)

- 99% coverage: 30 tests passing
- Objects 100%: VO validation, factories, hashability
- Client 100%: sinks, protocol compliance, registry binding
- Decorator 98%: sync/async callables, class fan-out, error paths
- Per-feature structure: mirrors source organization

### Documentation (✓ Approved)

- README: run-verified class-level example, clear architecture overview
- Docstrings: one-line on all modules/classes/methods
- CHANGELOG: Unreleased section with feature list
- CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/CODE_OF_CONDUCT: complete, first-person singular

### CI/CD Gates (✓ Approved)

- Six workflows: CI (pytest 3.11/3.12), ruff, mypy, dto-strict, no-ai-attribution, cleanup-guard
- Branch protection: required_status_checks.strict=true, all contexts
- License: Apache-2.0, 201 lines (canonical copy from domain-errors)
- py.typed: PEP 561 compliant for type stub consumers

## Conclusion

domain-monitoring 0.1.0 is **APPROVED** for release. Code is production-ready:
- Comprehensive design (metrics, sinks, decorator, registry)
- Full test coverage (99%)
- Clean type checking and linting (mypy/ruff pass)
- Security audit clear
- Documentation complete and verified

No changes required for v0.1.0. Ready to merge and publish.
