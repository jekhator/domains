# Policy Feature Review

**Date:** 2026-07-05  
**Branch:** feat/v01-policy  
**Verdict:** SHIP

## Scope

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `domain_api_limiter/services/policy/policy_objects.py` | 117 | Value objects: Period, RateLimit, TierRate, ThrottlePolicy |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/policy/policy_client.py` | 29 | Registry: policy introspection and collection |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/policy/__init__.py` | 11 | Public re-exports |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/constants/policy.py` | 20 | Constants: attribute keys and error messages |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/tests/test_policy/conftest.py` | 73 | Fixtures for policy tests |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/tests/test_policy/test_policy_objects.py` | 343 | Tests for value objects |
| `domain_api_limiter/services/tests/test_policy/test_policy_client.py` | 324 | Tests for registry |

## Standards Dimensions Checked (derived from source-of-truth)

1. **Frozen dataclass with slots=True, no repr=False** - All value objects (RateLimit, TierRate, ThrottlePolicy) use canonical form `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`.
2. **Facade ban (no module-level domain functions)** - PolicyRegistry encodes domain knowledge in methods, not module-level; Period enum follows vocabulary pattern.
3. **objects/client split with "as objs" aliasing** - policy_client.py imports `policy_objects as objs` and uses it in type hints (ThrottlePolicy, etc.); re-exported in policy/__init__.py.
4. **Absolute imports (no relative dots)** - All imports use absolute paths; no relative imports detected.
5. **__all__ + combined re-export idiom** - policy/__init__.py combines imports by source module in correct order (future, stdlib, first-party); single-line __all__ sorted alphabetically.
6. **One-line docstrings on every method, factory, property, validator** - RateLimit: from_rate() factory, period_seconds property, as_rate() method all have one-line docstrings. ThrottlePolicy: rate_for() and has_tiers property have one-line docstrings. PolicyRegistry: policy_of() and collect() have one-line docstrings. Class docstrings present for all value objects and registry.
7. **No inline # comments (only ⚠ SENSITIVE + noqa)** - No inline comments found.
8. **Intuitive variable names, no single-letter TypeVars** - No TypeVars in policy feature.
9. **Signature stacking (3+ params after self/cls)** - No methods exceed 2 params after self; no stacking required.
10. **Constants module with Final + docstring dividers** - constants/policy.py has docstring dividers separating THROTTLE_POLICY_ATTR (line 7) and error messages (line 12); all constants use Final type hint; module docstring "Imported as const." present.
11. **Error messages via const.ERR_*** - All error messages defined in constants/policy.py as ERR_POLICY_* constants; used in value-object validation (e.g., line 33 in policy_objects.py).
12. **Test<Concern> classes + fixtures-in-conftest + per-feature concern dirs** - conftest.py has 8 fixtures in correct location; test_policy_objects.py has TestPeriod, TestRateLimit, TestTierRate, TestThrottlePolicy; test_policy_client.py has TestPolicyRegistry. All follow correct structure.
13. **100% coverage** - Coverage report: TOTAL 100% (142 stmts, 0 miss).
14. **collections.abc over typing ABCs** - No ABC imports detected in policy feature.
15. **No RST/Sphinx markup** - All docstrings are plain prose.
16. **DTO field-grouping by concern** - RateLimit groups requests + period; TierRate groups tier + rate; ThrottlePolicy groups scope + rate + tier_rates (base vs. overrides).
17. **Module docstrings general-to-file, one-line for service/DTO** - policy_objects.py module docstring: "Throttle policy value objects: periods, rates, tier overrides, and the policy payload." (one-line). policy_client.py: "Declaration introspection: read and collect attached throttle policies." (one-line). Constants: "Throttle policy constants. Imported as const." (one-line).
18. **Multi-value constant collections use frozenset** - N/A; no multi-value constants.
19. **TypeVar/ParamSpec naming (descriptive, no single-letter)** - N/A; no TypeVars.

## Findings

**No findings.** All standards dimensions verified and passing. Policy feature cleanly implements frozen dataclasses, facade ban via registry pattern, correct objects/client split with as-objs aliasing, comprehensive error constants, and full test coverage.

## OBA Compliance Attestation

This review attests that domain-api-limiter (policy feature) conforms to published standards for Python package development: frozen dataclass discipline, object/client separation, test structure, constants extraction, and documentation discipline. The codebase undergoes no scanning for internal brand/employer identifiers; review focuses on structure and standards conformity only. Code is generic and portable across deployment contexts.

## Verdict

**SHIP**

The policy feature meets all standards dimensions derived from canonical source-of-truth documentation. No regressions detected. Ready for integration.
