# ErrorChain Service Review

**Date:** 2026-06-13  
**Feature:** chain (services/chain)  
**Scope:** Exception cascade traversal, ChainLink/DomainCrossing value objects, error domain resolution, structured-logging construction

## Findings

### Exception Cascade Walk

**Correctness: sound.**

The `history()` method (chain_client.py:34-63) correctly traverses the full exception chain in order: root exception first, then following `__cause__` (explicit raise-from) before `__context__` (implicit chained), respecting `__suppress_context__` to skip implicit context when the caller used `from err` syntax. The cycle guard (seen set, identity-based) is the right approach and bounds the walk to O(n) for n unique exceptions; it prevents infinite loops on self-referential chains without requiring reference-counting. Via-tagging (ROOT, CAUSE, CONTEXT) correctly tracks entry mode for each link.

Domain resolution (chain_client.py:78-90) is correct: it checks the error's own `domain` classvar first (const-sourced), then iterates classifiers in order, falling back to DEFAULT_DOMAIN. The contract for DomainClassifier (returning str | None) is clear and keeps the protocol open-ended.

### Value Objects and Logging

**Standards: fully conformant.**

ChainLink (chain_objects.py:50-72) and DomainCrossing (chain_objects.py:75-91) are frozen+slots with no repr=False, matching the canonical DTO shape. LinkLogExtra and CrossingLogExtra are transient value objects (not persisted); their structure is shaped for asdict() serialization, and both correctly use StrEnum.value to convert ChainVia enum to string before logging. The to_log_extra() methods correctly project the ChainLink into the shaped LinkLogExtra before serialization: the indirection avoids serializing the compare=False context field, keeping log payloads lean.

### ChainVia and DomainClassifier Contract

**Design: clean.**

ChainVia as StrEnum (root / cause / context) is self-documenting. The DomainClassifier protocol is minimal and typed: classify(err) → str | None. This contract is clear enough for consumers to implement (http, botocore, python classifiers can satisfy it).

### Constants and Imports

**Standards: conformant.**

Both constant modules (services/constants/chain.py and domains/constants/domain_error.py) are correctly partitioned: each has a module docstring (one-line, no RST), __all__ exports, and docstring partitions above the Final definitions. Import-as-const pattern is standard: `from domain_errors.services.constants import chain as const`.

### Docstrings

**Standards: conformant.**

All classes and methods have one-line docstrings in plain prose (no RST markup). Module docstrings are one-line and accurate.

### Residual Observations

- The wrap() method (chain_client.py:23-31) is minimal: it constructs a domain error from an exception without actually raising it yet. This is intentional (the caller raises with from err later) and correct per the typed-error pattern.
- No inline # comments; code is self-documenting.
- Frozen+slots with no repr=False is uniform across all DTOs.

## Verdict

ErrorChain is correct, standards-conformant, and ready. Exception traversal logic is sound; value object construction is clean; constants and docstrings follow the standard pattern. No defects or divergences.
