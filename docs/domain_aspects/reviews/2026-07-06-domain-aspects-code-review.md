# Code Review: domain-aspects 0.1.0

Date: 2026-07-06

## Scope

Code review of domain-aspects package v0.1.0: structure, patterns, test coverage, and alignment with project standards.

## Structure

- **Package layout**: Follows govtech OSS standards (config/_version.py, services/, errors/, tests/).
- **Entry objects** (aspects_objects.py): Six frozen+slots dataclasses with kind property and build() method.
- **Service class** (aspects_client.py): Aspects service with flatten/validate/sort/compose flow.
- **Constants** (services/constants/aspects.py): ASPECT_ORDER tuple and error messages.
- **Errors** (errors/aspects_errors.py): AspectsError and AspectDeclarationError subclasses.

## Patterns

- **DTO discipline**: All entries are frozen+slots dataclasses with `__post_init__` validation.
- **No facade**: Service class methods (flatten, validate, sort) are private; public interface is `__call__`.
- **Lazy imports**: Optional dependencies imported in entry.build(), not at module load.
- **Canonical ordering**: ASPECT_ORDER tuple enforces application order.
- **Error messages**: Extracted to constants/aspects.py and errors/constants/aspects.py per standards.

## Test Coverage

- **test_aspects_objects.py** (100% target): Entry creation, validation, hashability, kind property.
- **test_aspects_client.py** (95%+ target): Flatten, validate, sort, call, module-level entrypoint, integration.
- **Key paths**: Duplicate kind detection, unknown type rejection, empty declaration rejection, ordering verification.

## Standards Alignment

- **Frozen+slots**: Yes, all entry objects.
- **No inline comments**: Yes, no `#` comments (only pragmas where needed).
- **Docstrings**: One-line on all classes and public methods.
- **Error messages as constants**: Yes, ERR_* constants in both services/constants/ and errors/constants/.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Configured via workflows.
- **Attribution**: No AI-assistant attribution markers in code or commits.
- **Type hints**: Full coverage, TYPE_CHECKING imports for forward refs.

## Findings

No issues. Package implements approved design cleanly, follows all standards, and is ready for testing and release.
