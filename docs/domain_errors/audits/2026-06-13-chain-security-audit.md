# ErrorChain Security Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-13  
**Feature:** ErrorChain service, ChainLink, DomainCrossing, chain_objects module  
**Scope:** Exception cascade traversal, structured-logging payload construction, domain classification, cycle detection

## Findings

### Code Execution / Injection

**Status: No defects.**

The chain service performs no eval, exec, or deserialization of untrusted input. Classifiers are user-supplied callables (DomainClassifier protocol) that are trusted by contract: callers provide the classifiers and are responsible for their safety. No reflection beyond standard exception attribute access (`__cause__`, `__context__`, `__suppress_context__`, custom `code` and `domain` attrs).

### Denial of Service

**Status: Well-hardened.**

The `history()` method walks exception chains using a cycle guard: a `seen` set tracking object identity (`id(current)`). This prevents infinite loops on cyclic `__cause__` or `__context__` chains and bounds traversal to O(n) visits per unique exception. No unbounded recursion or memory allocation per chain link.

### Data Exposure / Logging

**Status: Data-handling guidance required.**

The `ChainLink.context` dict (line 59, domain_errors/services/chain/chain_objects.py) is an arbitrary `dict[str, object]` captured from exception kwargs and emitted directly into `to_log_extra()` structured-logging payloads (lines 61-72). Consumer code that places secrets, PII, or sensitive configuration values into the context dict will expose them in logger outputs.

**Mitigation:** Callers must not place secrets, PII, passwords, API keys, or regulated data into DomainError context or exception messages. This library does not mask or redact; logging system policies for sensitive-field redaction are the responsibility of the calling application.

### I/O, Subprocess, Filesystem, Network

**Status: No exposed surface.**

The service is stateless, in-memory only. No I/O, file access, network calls, or subprocess invocation.

### Secrets Handling / Key Material

**Status: Not applicable.**

This library does not manage, store, or transmit secrets, cryptographic keys, or authentication credentials.

### Authentication / Authorization

**Status: Not applicable.**

No authentication, authorization, or privilege boundary enforcement in this service.

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**Status: Not applicable.**

The library is single-tenant in design; data isolation is the responsibility of calling code.

## Conclusion

No code-level security defects. The sole handling note: callers must avoid placing secrets or PII in exception context or messages, as this library emits context directly into logs without redaction.
