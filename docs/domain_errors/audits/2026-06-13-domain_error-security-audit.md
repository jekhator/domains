# DomainError Security Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-13  
**Feature:** DomainError base class  
**Scope:** Exception initialization, context capture, message handling

## Findings

### Code Execution / Injection

**Status: No defects.**

`DomainError.__init__` accepts a message string and arbitrary kwargs. No eval, exec, string formatting with untrusted input, or dynamic attribute assignment. The message is stored as-is and passed to `super().__init__()` as a string. The context dict is stored without any transformation or interpretation.

### Denial of Service

**Status: No defects.**

Context kwargs are stored in a single dict with no recursive traversal or unbounded allocation. Exception instantiation is O(1) in memory and CPU.

### Data Exposure / Logging

**Status: Data-handling guidance required.**

The `context` dict (line 21, domain_errors/domains/domain_error/domain_error.py) captures arbitrary `**context` kwargs supplied by the caller. This dict is intended to flow into structured logs via the ErrorChain.history() and ChainLink.to_log_extra() methods and is not masked or redacted by this class.

**Mitigation:** Callers must not place secrets, PII, passwords, API keys, or regulated data into the context dict or the message string. This library does not mask, filter, or redact context or message content; responsibility for logging system policies and sensitive-field handling rests with the calling application.

### I/O, Subprocess, Filesystem, Network

**Status: No exposed surface.**

The class performs no I/O, file access, network calls, or subprocess invocation. It is a pure in-memory data container.

### Secrets Handling / Key Material

**Status: Not applicable.**

This class does not manage, store, or transmit secrets or cryptographic material.

### Authentication / Authorization

**Status: Not applicable.**

No authentication, authorization, or privilege enforcement.

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**Status: Not applicable.**

The class is single-tenant; isolation is the caller's responsibility.

## Conclusion

No code-level security defects. The core handling requirement: callers must not place secrets, PII, or regulated data into context kwargs or error messages, as this library passes them through to logs without masking.
