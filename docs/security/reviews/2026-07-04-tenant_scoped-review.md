# Code Review: tenant_scoped Feature

**Date:** 2026-07-04  
**Branch:** feat/v01-containers  
**Verdict:** SHIP

## Scope Reviewed

**Source files:**
- `domain_security/decorators/tenant_scoped/tenant_scoped_client.py`
- `domain_security/decorators/tenant_scoped/__init__.py`
- `domain_security/decorators/constants/tenant_scoped.py`

**Test files:**
- `domain_security/decorators/tests/test_tenant_scoped/` (conftest.py + test_tenant_scoped_client.py)

**Coverage:** 100% (3 source files, 0 lines uncovered)

## Standards Dimensions Checked

All 17 core standards dimensions derived from STANDARDS.md and cohesive-cleanup.md were evaluated:

1. **Frozen+slots dataclasses** (no repr=False) - N/A: Feature uses no dataclasses (TenantScoped is a decorator factory callable class).
2. **Facade ban** (no module-level domain functions) - PASS: TenantScoped encodes decorator logic; module-level `tenant_scoped = TenantScoped()` instance is sanctioned (mirrors requires pattern).
3. **Objects/client split with as objs aliasing** - N/A: Feature imports from context (SecurityContextManager, SecurityContext) and tenancy (TenancyGuard) using proper absolute imports.
4. **Absolute imports everywhere** - PASS: All imports are absolute.
5. **__all__ + combined re-exports** - PASS: __init__.py declares __all__ with two public exports (TenantScoped, tenant_scoped).
6. **One-line docstrings on every module/class/method** - PASS: Every module, class, and method has a one-line docstring.
7. **No inline comments** - PASS: No inline # comments present.
8. **Intuitive names + no single-letter TypeVars** - PASS: Uses Params = ParamSpec("Params") and Return = TypeVar("Return") following suite convention (not F/T/P/R).
9. **Signature stacking (3+ params after self/cls)** - N/A: No methods exceed 2 params after self/cls (3-param _tenant_argument is static, so no self).
10. **Constants modules with Final + docstring dividers** - PASS: SELF_TENANT_ID, ERR_TENANT_SCOPED_UNBOUND_SELF, and ERR_TENANT_SCOPED_PARAM_MISSING use Final with "Imported as const." module docstring and divider comments.
11. **Error messages via const.ERR_*** - PASS: tenant_scoped_client.py raises TenancyError with const.ERR_TENANT_SCOPED_UNBOUND_SELF (line 58) and const.ERR_TENANT_SCOPED_PARAM_MISSING (line 63). Both follow ERR_* pattern.
12. **Test<Concern> classes + fixtures-in-conftest + 100% coverage** - PASS: TestTenantScoped class in test file; fixtures in conftest.py; 100% coverage achieved. **Judgment note:** Tests deliberately pass the "self.tenant_id" literal (const.SELF_TENANT_ID) at three call sites to pin the public API contract string (consumer-facing input), while error-message assertions use const.ERR_* (documented pattern).
13. **Field-grouping by concern** - N/A: No value objects defined in feature.
14. **Module docstrings general-to-file** - PASS: One-line docstring on tenant_scoped_client.py; divider and docstring on constants module.
15. **Error wrapping with @wrap_errors or manual wrap/raise from e** - PASS: tenant_scoped_client.py:58,62 raises TenancyError directly without try-catch (appropriate for decorator pattern boundary enforcement).
16. **No AI attribution, brand-generic, no em dashes** - PASS: No attribution trailers, no brand literals, no em dashes.
17. **Collections.abc over typing.ABCs** - PASS: Imports Callable from collections.abc (line 7), not typing.

## Findings

None. All standards dimensions conform. Decorator uses inspect.signature and functools.wraps correctly; error handling follows tenancy boundary patterns.

## OBA Compliance Attestation

This feature uses only public patterns (functools, inspect, collections.abc, typing, standard library). Decorator composition and argument binding follow generic Python best practices. No proprietary IP references, no internal routine/phase language, no AI-attribution trailers.

## Verdict

**SHIP**
